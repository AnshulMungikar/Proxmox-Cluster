# Proxmox-Custer
I am trying to make a proxmox cluster.
# Proxmox Cluster Lab

This project documents my setup and experiments with building a **Proxmox VE cluster** at home.  
It currently consists of 2 nodes:

- Node 1: Main Proxmox server (running production VMs & containers)
- Node 2: Fresh Proxmox install (cluster member)

The goal is to:
- Create a Proxmox cluster
- Learn about centralized management
- Explore migration and shared storage options (NFS/CEPH)
